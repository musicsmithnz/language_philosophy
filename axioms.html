                The Universe is self-similar. If you observe a leaf, you will likely find that the pattern at which branches break off from a tree is very much alike the way stems break off from a branch, and how leaves break off from a stem, and how veins of leaves break off  from the centre of the leaf. The whole world works very much like this in a huge amount of ways. It's algorithmic and precise, and very small amounts of information have the ability to have a huge impact on the larger world. This is a study that is quite against the obsession with data today. Today, our method of study might be to count millions of leaves and try to calculate statistically how they will behave in the future. But a study of recursion will lead you to realize that huge amounts of this information is redundant, and you can probably learn more by looking deeply, and simply, but less broadly. The naked eye can see recursion in plants, even if it might need to be pointed out. Why the need for big data when such profound observations can be seen with the naked eye?

                Maybe this all sounds beautiful, but what does this have to do with coding? If the world is self similar, and if there are some kinds of mathematical laws of which hold true for atoms as well as for plants and the universe as a whole, then any principle that you apply to coding at one level -such as syntax, should also apply to coding at a higher level - such as the organization of objects within your program. 
            </p>
            <p>
                But why? Why should we imitate nature in this regard? The human mind is limited and can only hold a fairly small amount of information in consciousness at any moment of time. This is true both if you are thinking about syntax, and if you are thinking about code organization. Thus, if you are attempting to find a limit of complexity to a program which corresponds to the ability of a human being to understand. Every level of the program must be somewhere near the same complexity.

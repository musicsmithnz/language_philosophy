    <p>The em element represents stress emphasis of its contents.</p>
    <cite></cite>
</blockquote>
The level of stress that a particular piece of content has is given by its number of ancestor em elements.

The placement of stress emphasis changes the meaning of the sentence. The element thus forms an integral part of the content. The precise way in which stress is used in this way depends on the language.
